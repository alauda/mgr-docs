# 参数配置

## 功能简介
根据业务场景配置合适的 MySQL 参数可使数据库达到最佳使用状态，更好地支撑业务。MySQL-MGR 实例中默认使用 MySQL 及 Percona 官方提供的系统参数。您也可在界面便捷地配置参数。

平台提供参数模板用于定义一系列您期望的 MySQL 参数。创建实例时可通过参数模板批量修改默认参数，模板中未涉及的参数将维持默认值不变。
实例正常运行后，可更新 MySQL 参数。

更多参数信息请查阅 [MySQL 官网](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html) 及 [Percona 官网](https://docs.percona.com/percona-server/8.0/) 。

## 注意事项
修改参数配置将逐个重启容器组，可能会造成业务的短暂中断。


## 操作步骤
<Tabs>
<Tab label="CLI">
```bash
kubectl patch mysql -n ${namespace} ${name} --type='merge' --patch '
spec:
  params:
    mysql:
      mysqld:
        max_connections: "1000"
        binlog_expire_logs_seconds: "604800"
'
```
可以通过修改 CR 中的 spec.params.mysql 来修改参数，对应的参数 key 同 MySQL 参数一致。如上，指定 max_connections 为 1000，binlog_expire_logs_seconds 为 604800 也就是 7 天。

#### 使用推荐模板设置参数

**提示**：创建参数模板请参考 [参数模板]。

* 平台提供了多种规格的参数模板，供集群中任意 MySQL-MGR 实例使用。每种规格的参数模板均设置了 `loose_group_replication_paxos_single_leader: ON`、`sql_generate_invisible_primary_key: ON` 等系统参数，帮助提高 MySQL 易用性。

* MySQL-MGR 实例默认应用名称为 **ssd-2c4g-mysql-8.0-mgr** 的参数模板，您在创建 MySQL-MGR 实例时可根据实际的磁盘介质与实例规格选择对应的参数模板。

#### 更新参数

更新实例现有的参数配置后，实例将自动按顺序重启 MySQL 副本以使变更生效。

##### 操作步骤

1. 在左侧导航栏中，单击 **MySQL-MGR**。

2. 单击 ***命名空间的名称***。

2. 单击 ***实例名称*** 。

3. 在 **参数配置** 页签下，单击 **更新参数**。

4. 配置预期的参数，包括逐个配置，或批量导入。

    **注意**：导入参数时，请确保不包含 MySQL 不支持的参数，否则将导致实例无法启动。
    
5. 单击 **更新**。

##### 相关操作

如需复用其他实例的参数配置，您可以在源实例的 **参数配置** 页签下，单击导出参数，并参考参数模板创建自定义模板并批量导入参数。

Currently, the disallowed statements include CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE inside transactions, all updates to non-transactional tables, and CREATE TABLE ... SELECT. |
| binlog_gtid_simple_recovery | ON  | RestartApply | If this option is enabled, the server does not open more than two binary logs when initializing GTID_PURGED and GTID_EXECUTED, either during server restart or when binary logs are being purged. Enabling this option is useful when the server has already generated many binary logs without GTID events (e.g., having GTID_MODE = OFF). Note: If this option is enabled, GLOBAL.GTID_EXECUTED and GLOBAL.GTID_PURGED may be initialized wrongly in two cases: (1) All binary logs were generated by MySQL 5.7.5 or older, and GTID_MODE was ON for some binary logs but OFF for the newest binary log. (2) The oldest existing binary log was generated by MySQL 5.7.5 or older, and SET GTID_PURGED was issued after the oldest binary log was generated. If a wrong set is computed in one of case (1) or case (2), it will remain wrong even if the server is later restarted with this option disabled. |
| stored_program_cache | 256 | RestartApply | The soft upper limit for number of cached stored routines for one connection. |
| gtid_mode | OFF | RestartApply | Controls whether Global Transaction Identifiers (GTIDs) are enabled. Can be OFF, OFF_PERMISSIVE, ON_PERMISSIVE, or ON. OFF means that no transaction has a GTID. OFF_PERMISSIVE means that new transactions (committed in a client session using GTID_NEXT='AUTOMATIC') are not assigned any GTID, and replicated transactions are allowed to have or not have a GTID. ON_PERMISSIVE means that new transactions are assigned a GTID, and replicated transactions are allowed to have or not have a GTID. ON means that all transactions have a GTID. ON is required on a source before any replica can use SOURCE_AUTO_POSITION=1. To safely switch from OFF to ON, first set all servers to OFF_PERMISSIVE, then set all servers to ON_PERMISSIVE, then wait for all transactions without a GTID to be replicated and executed on all servers, and finally set all servers to GTID_MODE = ON. |
| gtid_executed_compression_period | 0   | RestartApply | Compress the mysql.gtid_executed table whenever this number of transactions have been added, by waking up a foreground thread (compress_gtid_table). This compression method only operates when binary logging is disabled on the replica; if binary logging is enabled, the table is compressed every time the binary log is rotated, and this value is ignored. Before MySQL 8.0.23, the default is 1000, and from MySQL 8.0.23, the default is zero, which disables this compression method. This is because in releases from MySQL 8.0.17, InnoDB transactions are written to the mysql.gtid_executed table by a separate process to non-InnoDB transactions. If the server has a mix of InnoDB and non-InnoDB transactions, attempting to compress the table with the compress_gtid_table thread can slow this process, so from MySQL 8.0.17 it is recommended that you set gtid_executed_compression_period to 0. |
| disconnect_on_expired_password | ON  | RestartApply | Give clients that don't signal password expiration support execution time error(s) instead of connection error |

Does it have any data? etc.); CHARACTERISTICS to track transaction state and report all statements needed to start a transaction with the same characteristics (isolation level, read only/read write, snapshot - but not any work done / data modified within the transaction). |
| session_track_state_change | OFF | RestartApply | Track changes to the 'session state'. |
| offline_mode | OFF | RestartApply | Make the server into offline mode |
| avoid_temporal_upgrade | OFF | RestartApply | When this option is enabled, the pre-5.6.4 temporal types are not upgraded to the new format for ALTER TABLE requests ADD/CHANGE/MODIFY COLUMN, ADD INDEX or FORCE operation. This variable is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. |
| show_old_temporals | OFF | RestartApply | When this option is enabled, the pre-5.6.4 temporal types will be marked in the 'SHOW CREATE TABLE' and 'INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS' table as a comment in COLUMN_TYPE field. This variable is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. |

| binlog_row_value_options |     | RestartApply | When set to PARTIAL_JSON, this option enables a space-efficient row-based binary log format for UPDATE statements that modify a JSON value using only the functions JSON_SET, JSON_REPLACE, and JSON_REMOVE. For such updates, only the modified parts of the JSON document are included in the binary log, so small changes of big documents may need significantly less space. |
| show_create_table_verbosity | OFF | RestartApply | When this option is enabled, it increases the verbosity of 'SHOW CREATE TABLE'. |
| secondary_engine_cost_threshold | 100000 | RestartApply | Controls which statements to consider for execution in a secondary storage engine. Only statements that have a cost estimate higher than this value will be attempted executed in a secondary storage engine. |
| sql_require_primary_key | OFF | RestartApply | When set, tables must be created with a primary key, and an existing primary key cannot be removed with 'ALTER TABLE'. Attempts to do so will result in an error. |
| sql_generate_invisible_primary_key | OFF | RestartApply | When set, if a table is created without a primary key then server generates invisible auto-increment column as a primary key for the table. |
| show_gipk_in_create_table_and_information_schema | ON  | RestartApply | When set, if a primary key is generated for a table then SHOW commands and INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables shows generated invisible primary key definition. |

| protocol_compression_algorithms |     | RestartApply | List of compression algorithms supported by server. Supported values are any combination of zlib, zstd, uncompressed. Command line clients may use the --compression-algorithms flag to specify a set of algorithms, and the connection will use an algorithm supported by both client and server. It picks zlib if both client and server support it; otherwise it picks zstd if both support it; otherwise it picks uncompressed if both support it; otherwise it fails. |
| replication_optimize_for_static_plugin_config | OFF | RestartApply | Optional flag that blocks plugin install/uninstall and allows skipping the acquisition of the lock to read from the plugin list and the usage of read-optimized spin-locks. Use only when plugin hook callback needs optimization (a lot of semi-sync replicas, for instance). |

| skip_replica_start | OFF | RestartApply | Do not start replication threads automatically when the server starts. |
| authentication_policy |     | RestartApply | Defines policies around how user account can be configured with Multi Factor authentication methods during CREATE/ALTER USER statement. This variable accepts at-most 3 comma separated list of authentication plugin names where each value refers to what authentication plugin should be used in place of 1st Factor Authentication (FA), 2FA and 3FA method. Value \* indicates any plugin is allowed for 1FA, 2FA and 3FA method. An empty value means nth FA method is optional. |
| skip_slave_start | OFF | RestartApply | This option is deprecated. Use skip_replica_start instead. |
| terminology_use_previous | NONE | RestartApply | Make monitoring tables and statements use the identifiers that were in use before they were changed in a given release. That includes names for mutexes, read/write locks, condition variables, memory allocations, thread names, thread stages, and thread commands. When the session option is set to BEFORE_8_0_26, the session uses the names that were in use until 8.0.25, when it selects from performance_schema tables, or selects from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PROCESSLIST, or issues SHOW PROCESSLIST or SHOW REPLICA STATUS. When the global option is set to BEFORE_8_0_26, new sessions use BEFORE_8_0_26 as default for the session option, and in addition the thread commands that were in use until 8.0.25 are written to the slow query log. |
| xa_detach_on_prepare | ON  | RestartApply | When set, XA transactions will be detached (AKA dissociated or disconnected) from connection as part of XA PREPARE. This means that the XA transaction can be committed/rolled back by any connection, even if the starting connection has not terminated, and the starting connection can start new transactions. As a side effect, temporary tables cannot be used inside XA transactions. When disabled, XA transactions are associated with the same connection until the session disconnects. ON is the only safe choice for replication. |

| innodb_buffer_pool_in_core_file | ON  | RestartApply | This option has no effect if @@core_file is OFF. If @@core_file is ON, and this option is OFF, then the core dump file will be generated only if it is possible to exclude buffer pool from it. As soon as it will be determined that such exclusion is impossible a warning will be emitted and @@core_file will be set to OFF to prevent generating a core dump. If this option is enabled (which is the default), then core dumping logic will not be affected.|
