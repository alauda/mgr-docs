# Monitoring

## Function Overview

The monitoring data embedded in the panel can be utilized for MySQL monitoring and alerts from the perspectives of resources, performance, and capacity, and it supports configuring notification strategies.

The intuitively presented monitoring data can provide decision-making support for operations inspection or performance tuning.

### Performance Monitoring Panel

The platform defaults to collecting common monitoring indicators related to MySQL's resources, performance, and capacity. In the instance's **Monitoring** tab, real-time monitoring data of the indicators can be viewed.

| Indicator                    | Default Monitoring Indicators                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Pod CPU Utilization          | Pod's CPU usage. Pods with a CPU usage exceeding 100% will be ignored, because under normal circumstances the CPU usage will not exceed 100%. If it exceeds 100%, please check whether all containers of the pod have set resource limits.                           |
| Pod Memory Utilization       | Pod's memory usage. Pods with a memory usage exceeding 100% will be ignored, because under normal circumstances memory usage will not exceed 100%. If it exceeds 100%, please check whether all containers of the pod have set resource limits.                       |
| Network Received             | The average bytes per second received from the network in the past 5 minutes                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Network Transmitted          | The average bytes per second sent onto the network in the last 5 minutes                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| PVC Used                     | PVC storage usage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| MySQL Connections            | Max Connections is the maximum permitted number of simultaneous client connections. By default, this is 151. Increasing this value increases the number of file descriptors that mysqld requires.                                                                      |
| MySQL Client Thread Activity | Threads Connected is the number of open connections, while Threads Running is the number of threads that are not sleeping.                                                                                                                                       |
| MySQL Table Locks            | MySQL takes a number of different locks for varying reasons. In this graph, we see how many table-level locks MySQL has requested from the storage engine.                                                                                                          |
| MySQL Sorts                  | This graph also shows when sorts had to scan a whole table or a specified range of a table in order to return the results that could not have been sorted via an index.                                                                                             |
| MySQL Slow Queries           | Slow queries are defined as queries that take longer than the long\_query\_time setting.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| InnoDB Buffer Pool Requests  | InnoDB Buffer Pool Requests refer to the total number of read and write requests made to the InnoDB buffer pool.                                                                                                                                                   |
| TPS                          | Transactions Per Second (TPS) is a key performance metric that measures the number of transactions MySQL processes per second.                                                                                                                                     |
| Commands                     | Commands refer to the number of SQL statements executed by MySQL, including queries, inserts, updates, deletes, and other database operations.                                                                                                                        |
