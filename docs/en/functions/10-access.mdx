# Access Methods

## Function Overview
Alauda Database for MySQL provides multiple ways to access MySQL-MGR clusters, supporting both internal and external cluster access. This section describes how to obtain appropriate connection addresses and establish connections to MySQL-MGR instances using the `mysql` client tool both inside and outside the cluster.
For detailed connection examples of client libraries, please refer to [How to Access MySQL-MGR Instances](../how_to/50-access)

## Procedure

### ClusterIP

<Tabs>
  <Tab label="CLI">
    1. Obtain the Service name: Based on the instance name, the corresponding Service names are `${name}-read-write` and `${name}-read-only`.
    2. Connect using the MySQL Client. For example, to access the read/write service:

        ```bash
        mysql -h${instance_name}-read-write.${namespace} -P3306 -u${username} -p${password}
        ```

    3. View member roles:

        ```bash
        select * from performance_schema.replication_group_members;
        ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab label="Web Console">
    1. Go to **Access Management** on the instance details page.
    2. Obtain the access method:

        - Internal access to the cluster: Read/write or read-only internal routing; formats are `${instance name}-read-write` and `${instance name}-read-only`.

    3. Obtain the account credentials.
    4. Connecting using the `mysql` client tool from outside the cluster or via terminal console. For example, to access the read-write service:

        ```bash
        mysql -h${instance_name}-read-write.${namespace} -P3306 -u${username} -p${password}
        ```

    5. View member roles:

        ```bash
        select * from performance_schema.replication_group_members;
        ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### NodePort

<Tabs>
  <Tab label="CLI">
    ::: tip Confirm the deployed access mode
    Ensure the field is configured as **NodePort**.

    ```bash
    kubectl -n ${namespace} get mysql ${name} -o jsonpath='{.spec.mgr.router.svcRW.type}'
    ```

    :::

    1. Obtain the NodePort access port:

        ```bash
        kubectl get svc -n ${namespace} ${name}-read-write -o jsonpath='{.spec.ports[0].nodePort}'
        ```

    2. Connect using the MySQL Client:

        ```bash
        mysql -h${node_ip} -P${port} -u${username} -p${password}
        ```

    3. View member roles:

        ```bash
        select * from performance_schema.replication_group_members;
        ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab label="Web Console">
    ::: tip Confirm the deployed access mode
    Navigate to **Access Management** on the instance details page, and check for **External Access - via NodePort**.
    :::

    1. Go to **Access Management** on the instance details page.
    2. Choose the access method:

        - External access - via NodePort: Read/write or read-only Router connection address.

    3. Obtain the account credentials.
    4. Connect using an external MySQL client tool or terminal console:

        ```bash
        mysql -h${node_ip} -P${port} -u${username} -p${password}
        ```

    5. View member roles:

        ```bash
        select * from performance_schema.replication_group_members;
        ```
  </Tab>
