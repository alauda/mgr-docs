# Delete Instance

::: tip Resources to be Deleted
Deleting an instance will automatically remove all safely deletable resources created by the instance, such as StatefulSets, Deployments, ConfigMaps, Secrets, and Services. Special resources that may contain important data need to be deleted manually, such as PersistentVolumeClaims and backup resources associated with MySQL-MGR, specifically mysqlbackups.mysql.middleware.alauda.io and its related actual data.
